The system uses:

- React 18 frontend
- Vite development server
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Express.js backend
- MongoDB database
- JWT authentication
- Google OAuth login support
- Docker Compose for local deployment

## 10. Database Entity Relationship Diagram

### 10.2 ERD Relationships

Draw the following relationship lines:

| `USER` | `CERTIFICATE` | One-to-Many | Student receives certificates |
| `USER` | `CERTIFICATE` | One-to-Many | Admin issues certificates |
| `USER` | `CERTIFICATE_RECOMMENDATION` | One-to-Many | Student receives recommendations |
| `USER` | `CERTIFICATE_RECOMMENDATION` | One-to-Many | Formator creates recommendations |

### 10.3 Foreign Key Mapping

Use these links when drawing connectors:

| Foreign Key | References |
| --- | --- |
| `EVALUATION.createdBy` | `USER._id` |
| `EVALUATION.assignedStudents[]` | `USER._id` |
| `EVALUATION.submissions.student` | `USER._id` |
| `RECOLLECTION.participants[]` | `USER._id` |
| `USER.registeredRecollections[]` | `RECOLLECTION._id` |
| `CERTIFICATE.student` | `USER._id` |
| `CERTIFICATE.issuedBy` | `USER._id` |
| `USER.certificates[]` | `CERTIFICATE._id` |
| `CERTIFICATE_RECOMMENDATION.student` | `USER._id` |
| `CERTIFICATE_RECOMMENDATION.recommendedBy` | `USER._id` |

### 10.4 Recommended ERD Layout

Use this layout when drawing the ERD:

```text
                         USER
                          |
        ---------------------------------------
        |            |            |           |
        v            v            v           v
   EVALUATION   RECOLLECTION  CERTIFICATE  CERTIFICATE_RECOMMENDATION
        |
        v
   SUBMISSION
```

Recommended placement:

- Put `USER` at the top or center.
- Put `EVALUATION` below-left of `USER`.
- Put `SUBMISSION` directly below `EVALUATION`.
- Put `RECOLLECTION` beside `EVALUATION`.
- Put `CERTIFICATE` to the right of `USER`.
- Put `CERTIFICATE_RECOMMENDATION` beside `CERTIFICATE`.

### 10.5 ERD Drawing Steps

1. Create a rectangle named `USER`.
2. Add all `USER` fields and mark `_id` as `PK`.
3. Create rectangles for `EVALUATION`, `SUBMISSION`, `RECOLLECTION`, `CERTIFICATE`, and `CERTIFICATE_RECOMMENDATION`.
4. Add each entity's fields from the tables above.
5. Mark all `_id` fields as `PK`.
6. Mark reference fields as `FK`.
7. Draw a one-to-many connector from `USER` to `EVALUATION` using `EVALUATION.createdBy`.
8. Draw a one-to-many connector from `EVALUATION` to `SUBMISSION`.
9. Draw a one-to-many connector from `USER` to `SUBMISSION` using `SUBMISSION.student`.
10. Draw a many-to-many connector between `USER` and `RECOLLECTION`.
11. Draw one-to-many connectors from `USER` to `CERTIFICATE` for both `student` and `issuedBy`.
12. Draw one-to-many connectors from `USER` to `CERTIFICATE_RECOMMENDATION` for both `student` and `recommendedBy`.
13. Label each connector with its relationship name, such as `creates`, `submits`, `registers`, `receives`, `issues`, and `recommends`.

### 10.6 Notes for Presentation

- `USER` is the central entity because students, formators, and admins are stored in the same collection.
- The `role` field determines user permissions.
- `SUBMISSION` is embedded in `EVALUATION` in the database, but shown separately in the ERD for clarity.
- `RECOLLECTION` has a many-to-many relationship with `USER` through `participants` and `registeredRecollections`.
- `CERTIFICATE` has two relationships with `USER`: the student who receives it and the admin who issues it.
- `CERTIFICATE_RECOMMENDATION` also has two relationships with `USER`: the student being recommended and the formator who recommended them.

## 14. Key Code Snippets

### API Client

File:

```text
frontend/src/services/api.js
```

Purpose:

- Sets API base URL
- Adds JSON headers
- Redirects to login on unauthorized responses

### JWT Login Response

File:

```text
backend/routes/auth.js
```

Purpose:

- Signs JWT
- Returns user data to frontend
- Redirect logic is handled by `Login.jsx`

### Certificate QR Generation

File:

```text
backend/routes/admin.js
```

Process:

1. Admin selects student and event details.
2. Backend creates QR data.
3. Backend generates QR image with `qrcode`.
4. Certificate is saved to MongoDB.
5. Student receives certificate reference.

### Certificate Verification

File:

```text
backend/routes/admin.js
```

Endpoint:

```text
POST /api/admin/certificates/verify
```

The endpoint accepts QR data and returns whether the certificate exists and is valid.

## 15. Recollection Flow Diagram

```text
Admin/Formator -> Frontend: Create recollection schedule
Frontend      -> Backend : POST /api/admin/recollections
Backend       -> MongoDB : Save recollection

Student       -> Frontend: Open Student Dashboard
Frontend      -> Backend : GET /api/student/dashboard
Backend       -> MongoDB : Find recollections by department and year level
MongoDB       -> Backend : Matching recollections
Backend       -> Frontend: recollectionSchedules
Frontend      -> Student : Show Participate button

Student       -> Frontend: Click Participate
Frontend      -> Backend : POST /api/student/recollections/:id/participate
Backend       -> MongoDB : Add student to participants
```

## 16. Evaluation Flow Diagram

```text
Admin/Formator -> Frontend: Create evaluation
Frontend      -> Backend : POST /api/admin/evaluations
Backend       -> MongoDB : Save evaluation and assigned students

Student       -> Frontend: Open dashboard
Frontend      -> Backend : GET /api/student/dashboard
Backend       -> MongoDB : Find assigned pending evaluations
Backend       -> Frontend: pendingEvaluations

Student       -> Frontend: Submit answers
Frontend      -> Backend : POST /api/student/evaluations/:id/submit
Backend       -> MongoDB : Save submission

## 17. Certificate Flow Diagram

```text

Frontend     -> Backend : POST /api/admin/certificates
Backend      -> Backend : Generate qrData and qrCode
Backend      -> MongoDB : Save certificate
Frontend     -> Admin   : Show QR code

Scanner Page -> Backend : POST /api/admin/certificates/verify
Backend      -> MongoDB : Find certificate by QR data
Backend      -> Scanner : Valid or invalid certificate info
```

## 18. Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt.
- JWT tokens are used for authenticated routes.
- Role checks are performed in backend route middleware.
- Frontend protected routes redirect unauthorized users.
- Session expires after 5 minutes of inactivity.
- Password reset tokens expire after 15 minutes.

## 19. Known Technical Limitations

- Forgot password is demo/local mode; no email provider is configured.
- Manage Accounts is read-only because admin edit/delete user endpoints are not implemented.
- Camera QR scanning depends on browser support for `BarcodeDetector`; manual verification is available as fallback.
- `frontend/dist` changes are generated build output.
