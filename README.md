## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm
- MongoDB 6 or higher, if running without Docker
- Docker and Docker Compose, if running with containers

## Environment Variables

### Backend

Create `backend/.env` when running the backend manually:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecms
JWT_SECRET=change-this-secret-in-production
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your-email@xu.edu.ph
SMTP_PASS=your-email-app-password
SMTP_FROM="Campus Ministry <your-email@xu.edu.ph>"
```

### Frontend

Create `frontend/.env` when running the frontend manually:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
```

Google login is optional. Leave the Google values blank if OAuth is not configured.

Email notification is optional during local development. If the SMTP variables are blank, recollection email notifications are shown in the backend console as email previews instead of being sent.

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Docker Compose

From the project root:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open the application:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Backend API:

```text
http://localhost:5000/api
```

View running services:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

View logs:

```bash
docker compose logs frontend
docker compose logs backend
```

Rebuild after code changes:

```bash
docker compose build frontend backend
docker compose up -d frontend backend
```

### Option 2: Manual Development Mode

Start MongoDB locally first, then run the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

In another terminal, run the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

```

Check for whitespace errors before committing:

```bash
git diff --check
```

## Documentation

Additional documentation is available in:

- `docs/USER_MANUAL.md` for non-technical users
- `docs/SYSTEM_MANUAL.md` for technical users

## Known Notes

- Forgot password is configured for demo/local use and displays the reset code on screen because no email provider is connected.
- Recollection email notifications require SMTP credentials. Without SMTP credentials, the backend logs email previews.
- Manage Accounts currently lists accounts. Edit and delete account endpoints are not yet implemented.
- QR camera scanning depends on browser support for `BarcodeDetector`. Manual QR verification is available as a fallback.
- Google login requires valid Google OAuth configuration.
